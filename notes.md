# notes to self

## research questions

remember that our objective is to answer the 2 research questions:

1. Does an information treatment of promotion incentives help workers update beliefs of
jobs in the industrial park?
2. Do misperceptions, especially of long-run promotion incentives, affect the turnover
decisions for high-skill and low-skill workers?


## variables

keep in mind question of which variables are relevant!

1. background information for workers
2. information of jobs
3. additional questions


## miscellaneous notes

- for minimum salary variable: recode TRUE into salary value, get min for row (exclude NAs) and store in new column
  - look thru indivs that have 1 followed by 0
- tag indivs that are outliers and decide on how to deal w/ outliers
- best way to summarize jobaspect? ranked choice variable
- work out github collaboration
