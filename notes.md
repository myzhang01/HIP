## research questions

remember that our objective is to answer the 2 research questions:

1. Does an information treatment of promotion incentives help workers update beliefs of
jobs in the industrial park?
2. Do misperceptions, especially of long-run promotion incentives, affect the turnover
decisions for high-skill and low-skill workers?


## variables

keep in mind question of which variables are relevant!

1. background information for workers
2. information of jobs
3. additional questions


## miscellaneous notes
